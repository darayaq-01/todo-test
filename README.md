This is a simple TODO list with persistence. Allows you to create a task list and the data will persist in the localstorage of your browser.

To install it, make a git `clone https://github.com/darayaq-01/todo-test.git`

To install all the dependencies, take care we use pnpm for that. So, the safest way to proceed is to do the same as we did.

Once the project is installed and also the dependencies are, you can use `pnpm run dev` to run the project
